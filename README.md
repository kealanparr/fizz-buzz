Hello!

I hope you'll find the solution acceptable.  

The `should` dependency is fairly simple, so to test my solution you can simply run `node index.js` - and as long as there's no assertions in the terminal like so -> https://imgur.com/DbjHhsG  
  
Then all the test cases pass :)  
  
Hope you're well,
